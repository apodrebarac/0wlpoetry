Themselves they said (14)

I held a Woman of hell
Hell not I, 
but your will as a man
Country of precious banishment

The night came

The God of extreme years arrived,
The eating-hour, over crying touch
Leave and cast them away
Prayers returned duke’s grief

Rage stayed

Force in a day
Luck in the sea
By command of a prince
Angry air, secret to hold

Been Taken (16)

Caused force in a day and hand
and his luck and all the sea
A service for his rage so warm
The greater burden from the King

Believing to her
Rose into the water

Hose embraces both ill forces
The other thing appeared to him
His father restores will of God
Lay himself into bed during sending

Calm yourself my King
Come and count dinning plates

Dining hall were empty very late
For once, sleep was lacking will
Dry warm wind brought hearing will
Believing her somewhere in hands

\I was taken away

Lack of the Prince (17)

Well reassured
I was a mistress
One of the worst youth
What King restores God?

Answer was inside
Grave of two and third
It pleased him well
Matters being sung 

Study of sleep 
Lack of price 
Was taken away
Well reassured

Ever seeking sense
Without given feet

Of his souls

Her Very Late (19)

I die in your lost desire,
for the Virgin Mary to blame.

Stories in the act of a saloon
Have them be welcome unto walls

They know the new love I consume
It lightly please you by default

Utmost gladness, 

still mine, 

firmly is,

Tales very late

______________________________

Footnote wish (20)

Given the power of blame and 
of making mock of his lodging.

They know the new love I consume
yet with poverty in a corner. 

Knowledge in her husband's cloth
Indeed, I sent them to it.

And you will never believe
I who have vouchsafed God

More than their own brother 
There he had said to him

His God, who was not dead
and their daughter a little 
I was a blind home to her 
And it is but that only my art

He had denied himself

To their words and taking it,

They borrowed death of all things
Stir harbour, looking as a word hidden

Needful wife,

Any privileges began to eat them alive
Lay no more, as they are bitting you
No longer, 
no rights
And by his dogs, 
they dealt with teeth
Determined to never return 
Look at me, Look at me

Fain His Mouth (33)

That him should celebrate those at the pain, 
into hand and calling her ill and remembering; 
Her way was unwise.

Flowers and making the truth whilst lying her,
It was sore affectionately exhorted until done.
Good young woman, 
but--thy father,
In laughing
In agony
In sleep
